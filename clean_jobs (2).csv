akt (pronounced “act”) is the personal performance company that may change your life. founded by west end stars ed currie and andy coxon, akt is by and for those who are “born to perform” — on the stage, at work, or in life.

 

in 2020, the deodorant balm made its stunning debut to rave reviews and awards from vogue, gq, esquire, and harper’s bazaar. plastic-free, aluminium-free, and gender-free, the deodorant balm instantly resonated with those looking for a natural deodorant that genuinely worked. five fragrances and over 200,000 happy armpits later, the deodorant balm is already becoming a household name.

 

to this day, every new akt product is put through its paces by london’s hard-working theatre community to ensure it lives up to the high standards of its founders. as a rule, akt’s products don’t break character — ever. it’s this effectiveness that has propelled akt from the backstage to bathroom cabinets, bedside tables, duffel bags, and carry-on luggage worldwide. and the good news is — the performance is just getting started.

 

about the role:

as data analyst you will be responsible for the end-to-end delivery of actionable insights that drive impact across akt. this is the first data analyst role for akt and so will work broadly guided by the head of data. the role covers the data spectrum from building data pipelines, analysis of complex datasets, designing and running ab tests, to developing powerful bi visualisations. akt is small and perfectly formed so this means we work on a varied set of initiatives, we use best in class tools, we learn a lot, and we work in an agile manner to deliver maximum impact.

support and upskill the team, where necessary, so that they can make the most of the dashboards in thoughtspot - our search and ai-driven analytics platform.

 

analysis & experimentation (35%)

scope out, structure and deliver analysis that helps the business understand what is going on, focus on the right things, and make the right decisions
be an advocate for data measurement and ab testing. support teams to design and implement tests so that we can be sure of the impacts of what we do, and learn as much as possible  

 

advanced analytics / projects (10%)

work on strategic, advanced data projects that add significant value to the business, whether building an attribution model, or forecasting demand

netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service. our members rely on netflix to entertain them, and we want to be the first place they go for that entertainment. with an audience of 600m+ and growing, we’re programming for more tastes, cultures and languages than any company has ever done before. it’s why we invest in a wide variety of tv shows and films, and work so hard to make them great.

the reach of netflix and the fandom we create fuels the “netflix effect” - a virtuous cycle of great content and intense fandom that catapults our stories into the cultural conversation. netflix influences what people around the world search for and talk about, the music they listen to, the books they read, the countries they visit, and how they dress.

our marketing efforts help to kick start the netflix effect, and we are providing more and more ways for fans to engage with our stores: tudum, events like netflix bites and bridgerton experiences, and the launch in 2025 of the first two netflix house locations.

netflix is a data-driven company, and we are hiring multiple data engineers to increase our data support for marketing and fandom activities around the world. the opportunity for impact in these roles is enormous: netflix social media channels generate more than 100b impressions a year, we are expanding fandom into the real world, and we’ve barely scratched the surface of the data available to support these activities.

what have you done and what do you know?


you have 8+ years of experience and proficiency building data pipelines in both batch and real-time settings, to support a variety of use cases. some of our data sources are small (e.g., sales at netflix house), and some are enormous (e.g., social media feeds). our stack is spark, flink, hive/iceberg, kafka - experience with these specific technologies is helpful, but not strictly required.
you are proficient in python for scripting, automation, and data orchestration frameworks, and you can write complex sql (any variant) for ad-hoc and recurring workflows. you strive to write elegant and maintainable code, and you're comfortable picking up new technologies.
you understand how to model data efficiently for reporting and metrics, and how to organize data for scale and fast retrieval.
you have experience sourcing and modeling data from application apis.
you’ve worked with common data warehouse solutions, such as snowflake, redshift, bigquery, vertica, teradata, greenplum, etc.


what will you do?


fully own critical pipelines and data sets to support netflix efforts around marketing and fandom.
directly collaborate with stakeholders to understand needs, model tables using data warehouse best practices, and develop data pipelines to ensure the timely delivery of high quality data.
creatively explore how to use data to continually add value to netflix. translate ambiguous business questions into clear data requirements, and then deliver on them.
be a bridge between data engineering and the business, enabling insights that empower our colleagues to make better and more informed decisions.
build strong partnerships with data scientists, analytics engineers, and machine learning practitioners to enable research and insight delivery for the business.


who are you?


you want to live and breathe the netflix culture. our ways of working are different, and you are excited to embrace and contribute to our culture.
you work quickly and independently while also collaborating effectively across functions (e.g. with marketing experts, data scientists, product managers).
you thrive in a fast paced environment, and see yourself as a partner with the business with the shared goal of moving the business forward.
you have a growth mindset, and expect the same from your colleagues. not only talented, you are also curious, authentic, selfless, determined, and industrious. you generously give and receive candid feedback, to grow yourself and those around you.
you have strong beliefs that are weakly held: you can deliberate and hear all sides of a discussion, and adapt to new perspectives that emerge from it.
you are a sharp communicator who can break down and explain complex data problems in clear and concise language.
you are comfortable getting outside of your comfort zone, to explore new tech, make your own tools, or find new creative ways to address an old problem.

why cisco

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

so, you have colorful hair? don’t care. tattoos? show off your ink. like polka dots? that’s cool. pop culture geek? many of us are. passion for technology and world changing? be you, with us!

why cisco

#wearecisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

we embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. and a security company. we even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. no other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

but “digital transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

day to day, we focus on the give and take. we give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our dna.) we take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

so, you have colorful hair? don’t care. tattoos? show off your ink. like polka dots? that’s cool. pop culture geek? many of us are. passion for technology and world changing? be you, with us!
