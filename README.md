# 📊 LinkedIn Job Search Dashboard

## 🔍 Project Overview
As a junior data analyst, I built this interactive **LinkedIn Job Search Dashboard** using Power BI to explore and visualize job market trends for data-related roles. The goal was to provide actionable insights for job seekers, recruiters, and educators.

## 👩‍💻 My Role
- Cleaned and transformed raw job data.
- Created new calculated columns and measures using DAX.
- Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI with slicers, charts, and KPIs.
- Interpreted insights to guide job search strategies and recruitment decisions.

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Cleaning
- **Job Categorization:**  
  - Created a new column called `job` by manually classifying job titles into 4 main categories:  
    `Data Analyst`, `Data Engineer`, `Data Scientist`, `Machine Learning & AI`, and `Other`.

- **City to Country Mapping:**  
  - Mapped cities to their respective countries and created a new `country` column for geographical analysis.

- **Salary Extraction:**  
  - Extracted salary information from unstructured text in the `description` column and stored it in a new column called `salary`.

- **DAX Measures:**  
  - Created custom measures for KPIs including:  
    - `Average Salary`  
    - `Total Jobs`  
    - `Jobs per Company`  
    - Min/Max salary comparisons per job category  
    - Frequency counts for most posted jobs
